# APKToWin10M

My little and fun Improvements of lost Project Astoria. Just for fun.

## Tech. details
- I found some strange Espaniol APKToWin10M app for Project Astoria (and oooldest Win10Mobile TP... 10240?)
- I decided to recover this old and fun thing. 
- Done! JetBrains decompiler used.

## My 2 cent
- Quick bug-fixing.
- Es->En fast "localization"
- Only 1 test: I tried to deploy helloworld.apk on my "donor Lumia device" 
  (L960 or L940 DualSim... I forgot))). Test failed (but same app, installed before, 
was magically deletet from applist)))

## BIG PLANS (FUTURE)
- I hope that one ay some geeks will build multi-platform version of APKToWin10M (UWP, Android, etc.) 
to simplyfy KitKat apk deploying/testing. :)
