## A few tech. moments
- I found some strange Espaniol APKToWin10M app for Project Astoria (and oooldest Win10Mobile TP... 10240?)
- I decided to recover this old and fun thing. 
- Done! JetBrains decompiler used.

## My 2 cents
- Quick bug-fixing.
- Es->En fast "localization"
- Only 1 test: I tried to deploy helloworld.apk on my "donor Lumia device" 
  Lumia LTE Dual Sim. Result: ok, app deployed successfully!

## BIG "PLANS" (DREAMS OF FUTURE?))
- I hope that one day some geeks will build multi-platform version of APKToWin10M (UWP, Android, etc.) 
  to simplify KitKat apk deploying/testing for Project Astoria. :)
